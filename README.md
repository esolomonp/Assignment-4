# Research on Flying Etiquette

### For this data set, researchers sought to gauge responses to questions regarding flying etiquette. 

The question that I found most interesting was: ***Is it rude to recline your seat on a plane?*** This is not a question I have given much thought to, as planes provide everyone with a reclining option. I never thought people would find it rude if it is utilized by passengers. Most of the other findings in the data set regarded questions like measuring the frequency of getting up to visit the lavatory or speaking to others around you. I find this question to be less controversial, which is why I was surprised by the mixed responses. 

My chart is able to reveal that although most respondents do not find reclining to be rude, a fair amount do. Out of the 854 polled:

- 502 said: *No, not rude at all*
- 281 said: *Yes, somewhat rude*
- 71 said, *Yes, very rude*

These numbers are displayed in a bar graph, as they are categorical answers and organized in a way in which the eye can discern key differences between each bar.
